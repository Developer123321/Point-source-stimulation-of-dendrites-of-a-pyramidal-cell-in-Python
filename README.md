# Point-source-stimulation-of-dendrites-of-a-pyramidal-cell-in-Python
This Python framework was developed during completion of my master thesis.
An L5 pyramidal cell from [^1] was investigated for intarcellular and extracellular stimulation.
Calcium driven AP spikes were of interest as well as several other phenomena.

[^1]: Ionic mechanisms of dendritic spikes (Almog and Korngreen 2014)

The project contains several objects:
- Cell.py: Constructs the cell in the very first stage,
- Stimulation.py: Constructs the interface in order to conduct electrical stimulation through either intracellular or extracellular stimulation upon Cell
- Trial.py: Deducting trials for determining the strengthDuration/Distance relations from either Stimulation or Cell instance
- main.py: Contains several scenarios and working examples

## rebuild_coordinates.py
Is used to align the axis of the soma along the y-axis of the coordinate system and save the data to "coordinates_horizontal.json", while leaving the rest as is. This is needed since the soma is then orianted towards an extracellular point source in a latter stage though appliance of a rotation matrix.
It should be run in case we haven't yet set "coordinates_horizontal.json" and "coordinates.json" data, which isn't the case for now.
Raw 3d-data of cell morphology is loaded from "cells/A140612.hoc" and then manipulated as indicated.
`rebuild_coordinates.get_children_list` stores data about parnet-child relationships in the form of
```
{
  "soma": [
    "apic[0]",
    "dend[41]",
    ...
  ],...
}
```
and is stored to linking.json

## Cell.py.compose_new_param
In case new_param.json is not set, use this function in order to create it from , before proceeding any further.
new_key.json contains the keys of optimized values which are determined by [^1].
best.params.json contains the optimized parameters for the cell. Cell.__init__() subsequently then constructs a list `biomech_list` of optimized parameters. Parameters which are also present in init_param.json are overwritten.

## Cell.__init__(self, stim_coord: list=[0,1300,0], construct_axon: bool=True)
It constructs the cell based on ion mechanisms as well as morphology settings from "Ionic mechanisms of dendritic spikes (Almog and Korngreen 2014)".
Furthermore, the axis of soma is oriented towards the `list` coordinates at decoration time. `construct_axon` indicates if an axon should be constructed or not.

## Stimulation.__init__(self, stim_coord: list=[0,1300,0], construct_axon: bool=True)
Directly inherits from Cell and augments it with an interface for appliance of electrical stimulation

## Trial.__init__(self, cell: Stimulation)
Inherits from class Stimulation and makes it ready for deduction of StrengthDistance/Duration curves

## trials/
Contains contucted trials from Trial.py. Data is save to csv files and then plotted

## plots/
Is the standard path where plots are stored in case Stimlation.py is used

## results/
Contains some deducted results from different settings and trials as well as morpgological plots of voltage-distribution at stimuli offsets.

Detailed information about how the whole cell was constructed as well as the distribution of ion channels is found in Chapter3 from thesis.pdf"# Point-source-stimulation-of-dendrites-of-a-pyramidal-cell-in-Python"
